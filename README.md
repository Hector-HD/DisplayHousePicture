# DisplayHousePicture
Amazon Alexa Skill that Invokes Image in Website to Display

Built Alexa Skill for API project for my CSE445: Distributed Software Development class. This skill is not a published Alexa Skill. The skill works after the user opens the skill and Alexa asks the user 'Welcome, to house pictures! What image would you like to see?'. The user then says the house number that they want to see and then the image is displayed in the entire screen for the user to see.

Technologies used:
